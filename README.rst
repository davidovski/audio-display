audio-display
=============

**audio-display** is a set of utility aimed at rendering images based on audio input.
It aims at generating images to produce visual "companion" to audio files. Typically to create
a video clip supporting a musical composition.

This fork aims to fix any bugs with the original (seemingly abandoned) project and to overall improve the functionality of this program.

fft2png
-------

**fft2png** is a command line utility to create a set of image files representing audio spectrum from a wav file.
It is an offline version of a spectrum analyser output and is not totally dissimilar to `Sonic Candle`_.

Generated files can be imported and postprocessed in any video edition tool accepting a set of images as input.
Just make sure that the framerate used during the call to **fft2png** matches the framerate at which you consume
images in your video edition software. Libre software able to consume and use those images includes, but aren't
limited to, Natron_.

You can also use FFmpeg_ for either previewing quickly or for simple needs (just the spectrum over a fixed image
or a video. Some samples of `ffmpeg usage`_ can be found later.

    Convert audio file to stack of images

**-r**
  Framerate of the generated images. Should match the framerate at which they will be consumed.
  Higher framerate gives a smoother result.

**-R**
  Aspect of the bar representing power for one frequency. 0 uses filled boxes, 1 uses hollow boxes,
  2 uses filled boxes vertically centered and 3 uses hollow boxes vertically centered.

**-w**
  Width (in pixel) per bar.

**-s**
  Spacing (in pixel) between bars.

**-c**
  Number of bars per images.

**-C**
  Color of the bars in hexa. Can be RGB or RGBA. For instance, FF0000 will render pure opaque red bars,
  00FF0080 will render 50% transparent pure green bars, ...

**-b**
  Blending ratio from previous frame into current one. When set to 0, only fresh data will be used to
  render bars. When set to 1, bars will be rendered from an average of the fresh and previous frame data.
  Intermediate values will inject a fraction of the previous frame data into the current one for rendering.
  Lower values tends to render more reactive spectrum while higher ones will smooth data over time and react slower.

**-W**
  Spectrum generation window is the amount of data in the audio file used to determine the spectrum raw data.
  Lower value will make spectrum blockier but will be slightly faster to generate.

Example
.......

To use default values when generating spectrum, just invoke::

    fft2png -i input.wav -o output-{:06}.png

`result of default fft2png settings`_

For a slightly different result, you can invoke it like this::

    fft2png -R2 -w4 -s4 -c30 -C FF8080A0 --audio-min-freq 100 -i input.wav -o output-{:06}.png

You'll end up with 30 symetrical transparent redish solid bars 4 pixels wide, spaced by 4 pixels

FFMpeg usage
............

.. _ffmpeg usage:

If you already have a video as background and want to add spectrogram center on it while adding some musique, you can
invoke ffmpeg like this::

    ffmpeg -i <background_video.mp4> -framerate <generated frames framerate> -i <audio-00%4d.png> -filter_complex "overlay=(main_w-overlay_w)/2:(main_h-overlay_h)/2:shortest=1" -i <music.wav> -map 2:0 -vframes <number of generated frames> -strict -2 <output.mp4> -y

where :
  * <background_video.mp4> is the filename of your background video
  * <generated frames framerate> is the framerate used when generating spectrogram frames
  * <audio-00%4d.png> is the mask of the generated frames to overlay
  * <music.wav> is the filename of the your music
  * <number of generated frames> is, well, the number of generated spectrogram frames
  * <output.mp4> is the generated muxed video

A few notes :
  * you can change the overlay position by setting the position in absolute coordinates or using some maths with main_w, main_h, overlay_w, overlay_h as show here
  * **-y** is for overwriting the result file
  * **-strict -2** alleviates some error with aac encoding on my version/system combo
  * the background video will not loop. As for now (ffmpeg 3.0.1), looping is not for video. If your video is too short, prepare one which is long enough by concatenating it several times. The **shortest=1** in the filter expression will  stop whenever an input stream (background video, spectrogram images or music) reaches its end.
  * use the ffmpeg manual, Luke

If you want to use a static image as background, the invocation becomes something like::

    ffmpeg -loop 1 -i <background_image.jpg> -framerate <generated frames framerate> -i <audio-00%4d.png> -filter_complex "overlay=(main_w-overlay_w)/2:(main_h-overlay_h)/2:shortest=1" -i <music.wav> -map 2:0 -vframes <number of generated frames> -strict -2 <output.mp4> -y

The main difference being the **-loop 1** to loop the background image over and over until one of the other
stream ends.
